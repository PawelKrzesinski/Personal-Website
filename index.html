					<h1>...For last almost 10 years i have been working as a chef
						and in summer 2019, i decided, this is not for me.
						I love cooking, but as a hobby, not a profession.
						I always have been more in to tech stuff. Had my very
						first PC when i was around 9 years old. I graduated 
						an IT high school, then because of a family situation
						i started helping out in a family restaurant. I was working in different
						kitchens since then...
